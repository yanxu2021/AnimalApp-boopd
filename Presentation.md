- Share a notable blocker your team overcame
Tech blocker: We had problem to get the default value, we got undefined instead. Make sure the conditional render() correct, It render the page before loading that field. Using functional component easily to solve that problem. The functional component render after everything loaded. No delay between. And also we learn functional component from React Material UI. 
UI blocker: The most style for the form on the create page, animation on the home page, figure out how they positioned with CSS be more responsible. absolution postioning to make sure working with containder. with the container be controled and responsive. 
CSS animation. key animation. each letter stored in individule image/item. @keyframe attribute: animation: bounce how long, delay, ease out, how many repeat.
Product blocker: very first test. implement mock data to test Create. 
Project blocker: communication, sth like using space or tab to get indentation. LOL, just kiding. I think we all learning from every meeting and pair programming. There is not that much
