### Introduce yourself and your role on the team
- Hi, my name is Yan, I am currently studying in LEARN Academy /əˈkædəmi/ and working in Team KYAC as project manager. 
- I am certified in project management since 2008. I am comfort with a variety /vəˈraɪəti/ of technologies, and willing to learn new things instead stay with same tasks everyday.

### Share a notable blocker your team overcame
- Project blocker: As the project manager, my blocker is more on communication, sth like using space or tab to get indentation/ˌɪndenˈteɪʃn/缩排. LOL, just kidding. Our project blocker was to get clearly project scope, what is the must-have, what is the stretch challenge, how to  think big and act small. 
- Tech blocker: We had problem to get the default value, we got undefined instead. Make sure the conditional render() correct, It render the page before loading that field. Using functional component easily to solve that problem. The functional component render after everything loaded. No delay between. And also we learn functional component from React Material UI. 
- UI blocker: The most style for the form on the create page, animation on the home page, figure out how they positioned with CSS be more responsible. absolution positioning to make sure working with container. with the container be controlled and responsive. CSS animation. key animation. each letter stored in individual image/item. @keyframe attribute: animation: bounce how long, delay, ease out, how many repeat.
- Product blocker: very first test. implement mock data to test Create. 

### Share what a typical day looked like for your team during the project
After check-in and stand up, we always get a coffee chat then start a day with our Trello board doing/MVP section. If needed update the cards/checklist or assign the member to finish that task. We make sure everyone on the same page, and each card with task can be done in half of day so we can pull request as a milestone to get review and approve, then move to the next task to push the project forward. Most of days, we had our mentor session in the afternoon, we always discuss our blocker after lunch but before the mentor session so that we have something need to figure out and efficiently use mentorship time to get that blocker problem asked and solved properly. We learned a lot from mentor session.   
## Wrap-up (2 min)
- Each person share something you learned
Never done learning. When pair programming, don't be afraid to ask questions and argue if there is misunderstanding and be brave to the new topic. 
- Each person share some advice for the next cohort
Maybe at first everything look like no sense at all but after implementation/practice/repeat and have that blocker resolved, it turns out easy-going and handy.
